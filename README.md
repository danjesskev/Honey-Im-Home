## Overview
### Description
Sends text messages notifying selected contacts when user has reached his or her home. 

### App Evaluation
- **Category:** Social Networking 
- **Mobile:** This app would be limited to mobile because it uses text messaging. There could be an option to configure setting through a website/web app, but this seems unnecessary because phones are typically the most convenient. 
- **Story:** Allows users to select important contacts to notify when they have reached their home. They can change their location and input more contacts as they go.
- **Market:** Any individual that is away from home and wishes to contact friends or family when he/she gets home.
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often or unoften as the user wanted depending on how often they go out
- **Scope:** Anybody with access to iMessage can use this app. We can eventually implement an android version.
